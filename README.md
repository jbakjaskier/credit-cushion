# Credit Cushion

Credit Cushion transforms financial hardship management into a smooth journey. With built-in DocuSign integration, we help financial providers deliver faster resolutions while building customer trust.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## How we built it

Credit Cushion was built using NEXT JS as the platform to build Credit Cushion on with Tailwind CSS for styling and MongoDb for persistence. 

- Credit Cushion Login was built using Session Cookies (with JoseJWT package) and the DocuSign Auth APIs
- Loading of the Personal Loan Template and WebHook Connect Configuration was done using the DocuSign Template API and DocuSign Connect API respectively. 
- Credit Cushion AI used in features like "Loan Assistant", "Hardship Management" and "Generating Variation of Contract" was built using Google Gemini. 
- TinyMCE is the WYSIWYG editor used for reviewing the variation of contract generated by Credit Cushion AI.
